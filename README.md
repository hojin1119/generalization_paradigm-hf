# Risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure with sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril in clinical practice: application of outcome models developed with clinical trial data from PARADIGM-HF.


This is the code repository for our forthcoming publication regarding the generalization of treatment effects from the PARADIGM-HF trial to a target population of US Medicare beneficiaries in clinical practice. In this study, we developed outcome risk prediction models using individual participant-level data from PARADIGM-HF to predict the average treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril in trial-eligible US Medicare beneficiaries with indications for treatment.
